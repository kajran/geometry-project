Let ABC be an acute triangle with orthocenter H, and let W be a point on the side BC, between B and C. The points M and N are the feet of the altitudes drawn from B and C, respectively. Suppose ω1 is the circumcircle of triangle BW N and
X is a point such that W X is a diameter of ω1. Similarly, ω2 is the circumcircle of triangle CWM and Y is a point such that W Y is a diameter of ω2. Show that the points X, Y , and H are collinear.
